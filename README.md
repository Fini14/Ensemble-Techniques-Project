# Ensemble-Techniques-Project
This project is based on the case study of a telecommunication company, which is facing a customer churn issue. The project aims at understanding the pattern of the data and predicting customers who are going to churn based on multiple variables to help the company in retaining their existing customers. The project was accomplished by building a machine learning workflow that will run autonomously with the CSV file and return the best-performing model.
# Skills and Tools: 
EDA, Logistic regression, Decision Trees, Random forest, XGboost, Adaboost, python, ML workflow
# Part A:
# DOMAIN: 
Telecom
# CONTEXT: 
A  telecom  company  wants  to  use  their  historical  customer  data  to  predict  behaviour  to  retain  customers.  You  can  analyse  all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.
DATA  DESCRIPTION: 
Each  row  represents  a  customer,  each  column  contains  customer’s  attributes  described  on  the  column  Metadata.  
  The data set includes information about:
  1.Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn, 2.Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies, 3.Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges, 4.Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
# PROJECT OBJECTIVE: 
To build a model that will help to identify the potential customers who have a higher probability to churn. This helps the company to understand the pinpoints and patterns of customer churn and will increase the focus on strategizing customer retention.
# Part B:
# DOMAIN: 
IT
# CONTEXT: 
The  purpose  is  to  build  a  machine  learning  workflow  that  will  work  autonomously  irrespective  of  Data  and  users  can  save  efforts involved in building workflows for each dataset.
# PROJECT OBJECTIVE: 
Build a machine learning workflow that will run autonomously with the csv file and return best performing model
